# Integrative Project
Integrative personal project in sec 5 (grade 11). The project consists of an online website (no domain, never posted because of Covid) used to make seat reservations in my high school's auditorium. This would facilitate many events and planning. The first page is the home-opening page. The other pages are linked inside the code already.
